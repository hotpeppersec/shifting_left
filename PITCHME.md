Note:

- You can **follow along** with this talk on my github (hotpeppersec).
- There are links throughout the presentation that you can click on for greater detail.
- I realize this presentation is currently a bit wonky when viewed on a mobile device.
  - I'm working on it, don't @ me.
- My speaking style is fairly informal and if you stop me with a question I will do my best to answer it.

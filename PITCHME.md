Note:

- You can **follow along** with this talk on my github (hotpeppersec).
- There are links throughout the presentation that you can click on for greater detail.
- I realize this presentation is currently a bit wonky when viewed on a mobile device.
  - I'm working on it, don't @ me.
- My speaking style is fairly informal and if you stop me with a question I will do my best to answer it.

Uniformity
@snapend

@snap[south-west span-200 text-left text-08 text-orange]
@ul[circles](false)

- Your situation is not so unique that you qualify for an exception.
- Drive out fragmented security process.
  - Security tends to vary by application/location/team.
  - Disparate systems contribute to gaps in network security posture.
- Avoid looking at "slices" of traffic or applications.
  - Go for holism.
